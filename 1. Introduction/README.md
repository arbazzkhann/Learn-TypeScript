# TypeScript

## What is typescript?

* **Strongly-typed** superset of javascript.
* Adds **static typing** to the language and **other features too**.
* Provides **better error checking**, **enhanced tools**, **improved code readability**.

## TypeScript vs JavaScript:

* **TypeScript**:
    * **Statically typed** language like (C++, C#, Java).
    * Needs to be **compiled**.
    * **Compiled time error**.
    * **Better support** with **interfaces**, **classes**, and **generics**.
    * **Learning is higher** due to **static types** and **additional features**.
    * **Easier to scale** with **static types**, and **strong typing**.
    * **Suitable for large**, **complex applications**.
    * **Can use JavaScipt libraries** and **code**.
    * **Slower** due to **type checks** and **compiling**.
    * **Growing**, particularly for **large-scale applications**.
    * **Rich tooling** and **editor support** with **autocompletion and refactoring**.
    * **Includes** all **ES6+** features and future proposals.

* **JavaScript**:
    * **Dynamic typed** language like (Python, Ruby).
    * **Directly executed** by *browsers* and **Node.js**
    * **Errors** occur at **runtime**.
    * **Basic support** with **prototype-based OOP**.
    * **Easier to learn** as it's simpler.
    * More **challening to scale** due to **dynamic typing**.
    * **Ideal for smaller projects** and fast prototyping.
    * Fully **interoperable** with TypeScipt.
    * **Faster** as **no compilation required**.
    * **Large** and **well-established community**.
    * **Basic tooling support**.
    * **Includes ES6+ features**, but **depends on browsers**/**Node.js version**
