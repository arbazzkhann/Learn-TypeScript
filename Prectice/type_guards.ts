// ────────────────────────────────────────── Type guards
/*
Type guards: 
    Expressions or functions that performs runtime checks to guarantee the type of a variable
    within a specific scope.

Without Type Guards:
    TypeScript often cannot determine the specific type of a variable,
    Leading to errors when accessing type-specific properties.

Type Guards Provides:
    - Enforcing Type Safety.
    - Preventing Runtime Errors.
    - Improving Code Intelligence.
